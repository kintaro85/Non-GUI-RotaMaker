# Non-GUI-RotaMaker
A program that writes a csv file, organizing employees with different availability over 5 days with different staffing needs. 

My first attempts a trying to speed up my rota planning.

Updating each instance on a weekly basis reveald to be messier then expected.

But overall, the program does what it was intended to do.
